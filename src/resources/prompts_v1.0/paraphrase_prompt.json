Focus on altering the structure, vocabulary, and phrasing while maintaining the core essence and intent of the original question. The goal is to create a diverse set of questions that are semantically equivalent to the given one, providing various ways to ask the same question in different contexts or settings.\n\nDesired output:\n[\n    \"QUESTION1\",\n    \"QUESTION2\",\n    ...\n    \"QUESTION10\"\n]\n\nEnsure that each paraphrased question remains clear, concise, and faithful to the original question's meaning. This task emphasizes creativity and linguistic variation in rephrasing the question, aiming to explore different angles and expressions that maintain the original intent.\n"
